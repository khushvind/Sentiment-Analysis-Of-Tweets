# Sentiment-Analysis-Of-Tweets
 
## Introduction 
Disaster management and response require timely and accurate information. Social media platforms, especially Twitter, are valuable sources of real-time data during such events. This project utilizes BERT, a state-of-the-art NLP model, to classify tweets related to disasters.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled tweets that indicate whether the tweet is about a disaster (1) or not (0). The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes various types of disaster-related content.

## Model
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model designed to understand the context of a word in search queries. BERT has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text and fine-tuned on the specific task of tweet classification in this project.
